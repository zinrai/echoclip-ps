# echoclip-ps

A PowerShell tool that listens for TCP connections and copies received text to the Windows clipboard.

## Background

The motivation behind this tool was to enable seamless clipboard integration between [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) sessions running on a Debian GNU/Linux virtual machine and the Windows host system. It allows text copied within tmux to be immediately available for pasting in Windows applications.
